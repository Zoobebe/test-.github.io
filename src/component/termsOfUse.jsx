        connection with such an account. You may not create an account on behalf
        of a legal entity unless you have been authorized by that legal entity to
        do so. Accounts created on behalf of a legal entity must designate at
        least one individual as an authorized user that will have the authority to
        bind the legal entity. CFS reserves the right to contact the legal entity
        you have created an account for to verify that you have been authorized to
        create an account on its behalf. You may never use another’s account
        without permission from an authorized user. You are responsible for
        maintaining the confidentiality of the password and account and are fully
        responsible for all activities that occur under your password or account.
        CFS cannot and will not be liable for any loss or damage arising from your
        failure to comply with this Section.

        provide will be entirely truthful and accurate. If the information that
        you provide to CFS changes, you agree to promptly provide CFS with updated
        information.

          Otherwise applicable sections of the Terms of Use shall survive any
